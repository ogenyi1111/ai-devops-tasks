I'll explain the relationships between the pipeline stages in the Mermaid diagram.

1. **Initial Flow (Development & Testing)**
   - `Start → Checkout → Build → Test → StaticAnalysis → SecurityChecks`
   - This is the initial sequential flow where:
     - Code is first checked out from the repository
     - Application is built
     - Unit tests are run
     - Static code analysis is performed
     - Security checks are conducted
   - Each stage must pass for the pipeline to continue to the next stage

2. **Containerization & Integration**
   - `SecurityChecks → DockerBuild → IntegrationTests`
   - After security checks pass:
     - Docker image is built
     - Integration tests are run to verify system components work together
   - This phase ensures the application works as a complete system

3. **Staging Deployment Flow**
   - `IntegrationTests → StagingDeploy → Staging → StagingTests → StagingApproval`
   - This is a conditional flow with manual intervention:
     - First, there's a decision point (`StagingDeploy`) to approve staging deployment
     - If approved, deployment to staging occurs
     - Staging tests are run
     - Another approval (`StagingApproval`) is required before proceeding to production

4. **Production Deployment Flow**
   - `StagingApproval → ProductionDeploy → Production → ProductionTests → End`
   - This is the final phase with additional safety checks:
     - Requires approval from staging phase
     - Has another decision point (`ProductionDeploy`) for production deployment
     - If approved, deploys to production
     - Runs final production tests
     - Pipeline completes successfully

5. **Failure Paths**
   - Each major stage has a failure path:
     - `Test → TestFailure`
     - `StaticAnalysis → AnalysisFailure`
     - `SecurityChecks → SecurityFailure`
     - `IntegrationTests → IntegrationFailure`
     - `StagingTests → StagingFailure`
     - `ProductionTests → ProductionFailure`
   - These paths represent where the pipeline can fail and stop

6. **Decision Points**
   - Three main decision points in the pipeline:
     - `StagingDeploy`: Decides whether to deploy to staging
     - `StagingApproval`: Approves staging deployment before production
     - `ProductionDeploy`: Final approval for production deployment
   - These create gates that require manual intervention

7. **Styling Relationships**
   - Success states (green): `Start` and `End`
   - Process states (gray): All main pipeline stages
   - Decision points (yellow): Deployment approval stages
   - Failure states (red): All failure endpoints

This pipeline design follows a "shift-left" approach where:
- Testing and security checks happen early
- Multiple approval gates ensure quality
- Clear separation between staging and production
- Each stage builds upon the success of previous stages
- Failures are clearly identified and handled

Would you like me to:
1. Explain any specific stage relationship in more detail?
2. Provide examples of what happens in each stage?
3. Explain the decision points and approval process?
4. Describe the failure handling in more detail?
