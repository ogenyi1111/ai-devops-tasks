[Docker Service Check Script Explanation]
```bash
#!/bin/bash
# This line is called a "shebang". It tells the system to use bash to execute this script.

# Check if Docker service is running
if systemctl is-active --quiet docker; then
    # This line checks if Docker is running using systemctl (system control)
    # - is-active: checks if a service is running
    # - --quiet: makes the command not output anything
    # - docker: the service we're checking
    # - then: what to do if the check is successful

    echo "Docker service is already running"
    # If Docker is running, print this message to the screen
else
    # If Docker is not running, do the following:

    echo "Docker service is not running. Starting Docker..."
    # Print a message telling the user we're going to start Docker

    sudo systemctl start docker
    # Try to start Docker
    # - sudo: run the command with administrator privileges
    # - systemctl start: command to start a service
    # - docker: the service to start
    
    # Verify if Docker started successfully
    if systemctl is-active --quiet docker; then
        # Check again if Docker is now running
        
        echo "Docker service started successfully"
        # If Docker is running, print success message
    else
        # If Docker still isn't running
        
        echo "Failed to start Docker service"
        # Print error message
        
        exit 1
        # Exit the script with error code 1
        # This tells other programs that something went wrong
    fi
fi
```

Key Concepts:
1. systemctl: A command-line tool to control the system and service manager
2. if/else: Conditional statements that make decisions in the script
3. echo: Command to print text to the screen
4. sudo: Command to run something with administrator privileges
5. exit: Command to end the script, with a number indicating success (0) or failure (non-zero)
