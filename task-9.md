services:
  web:
    image: nginx
    ports:
      - "80:80"
  app:
    build: .
    ports
      - "3000:3000"
    depends_on:
      - db
  db:
    image: postgres
    environment:
      POSTGRES_PASSWORD=password

No, this code is not valid. There are a few syntax errors in the YAML file. Let me help you fix it:
There's a missing colon (:) after ports in the app service
The indentation needs to be consistent
Here's the corrected version:

services:
  web:
    image: nginx
    ports:
      - "80:80"
  app:
    build: .
    ports:    # Added missing colon here
      - "3000:3000"
    depends_on:
      - db
  db:
    image: postgres
    environment:
      POSTGRES_PASSWORD: password  # Added colon for consistency

# Explanation of fixes:
# 1. Added missing colon after 'ports' in app service
# 2. Changed POSTGRES_PASSWORD=password to POSTGRES_PASSWORD: password
#    (both syntaxes work, but using : is more consistent with YAML style)
