```

## Log Analysis

### 1. First Log Entry (10:15:32)
- Container `78a2b3c4` was initially starting up
- It successfully passed its health checks
- Status changed to "healthy"

### 2. Second Log Entry (10:16:45)
- Container tried to connect to a PostgreSQL database (port 5432)
- Connection was refused
- Target IP: 172.17.0.3 (another container in the Docker network)
- This indicates the database container might be:
  - Not running
  - Not ready to accept connections
  - Having network issues

### 3. Third Log Entry (10:16:47)
- Due to the failed database connection
- Container's health status degraded to "unhealthy"
- This happened 2 seconds after the connection failure

## Identified Issues

1. **Database Connectivity Problem**
   - Container can't connect to PostgreSQL
   - Connection is being refused
   - This is the root cause of the health status change

2. **Health Check Failure**
   - Container's health checks are failing
   - This could trigger container restarts or other orchestration actions

3. **Timing Issue**
   - Container was healthy for about 1 minute and 13 seconds
   - Then suddenly lost database connectivity

## Possible Causes

1. Database container might have:
   - Crashed
   - Not started properly
   - Network configuration issues
2. Database might be:
   - Still initializing
   - Overloaded
   - Having resource constraints

## Troubleshooting Steps

1. Check if the database container is running:
   ```bash
   docker ps | grep 172.17.0.3
   ```

2. Verify database container logs:
   ```bash
   docker logs <database-container-id>
   ```

3. Check network connectivity:
   ```bash
   docker network inspect <network-name>
   ```

4. Ensure proper container dependencies in docker-compose.yml:
   ```yaml
   services:
     app:
       depends_on:
         - db
     db:
       image: postgres
   ```
