I'll refactor this function to make it more maintainable and clearer using a configuration object and better error handling.



I've refactored the code with several improvements:

1. **Configuration Object**
   - Moved all environment configurations into a single `ENV_CONFIGS` object
   - Makes it easier to add/modify environments
   - Reduces code duplication
   - Makes the structure more visible

2. **Default Configuration**
   - Added a `DEFAULT_CONFIG` constant
   - Clearly shows what happens when no environment is specified
   - Uses development config as default

3. **Better Error Handling**
   - Added proper error checking
   - Throws descriptive errors for invalid environments
   - Lists valid environments in error message
   - Handles case-insensitive environment names

4. **Input Validation**
   - Checks for missing environment parameter
   - Provides warning when using default configuration
   - Validates environment name against available configurations

5. **Documentation**
   - Added JSDoc comments
   - Clear parameter and return type documentation
   - Documents possible errors

6. **Example Usage**
   - Added example code showing how to use the function
   - Demonstrates error handling
   - Shows different environment configurations

Benefits of this refactoring:
1. **Maintainability**
   - Easier to add new environments
   - Configuration is centralized
   - Less code duplication

2. **Reliability**
   - Better error handling
   - Input validation
   - Clear default behavior

3. **Readability**
   - Clear structure
   - Well-documented
   - Example usage included

4. **Flexibility**
   - Easy to modify configurations
   - Easy to add new environments
   - Case-insensitive environment names

Would you like me to explain any part of the refactoring in more detail or make any additional improvements?
