I've created a PowerShell script that provides equivalent functionality to the Bash script, with some Windows-specific improvements. Here are the key changes and features:

1. **Path Handling**
   - Uses Windows-style paths (`C:\Backups\DB`)
   - Uses `Join-Path` for proper path construction
   - Handles Windows path separators correctly

2. **Date Formatting**
   - Uses PowerShell's `Get-Date` with custom format
   - Matches the original format (YYYYMMDD_HHMMSS)

3. **Directory Creation**
   - Uses `Test-Path` instead of `[ -d ]`
   - Uses `New-Item` with proper error handling
   - Includes try-catch block for better error management

4. **Compression Options**
   - Primary method uses 7-Zip (common on Windows)
   - Alternative method using .NET's GZipStream (commented out)
   - Both methods provide gzip compression

5. **Error Handling**
   - Uses PowerShell's try-catch blocks
   - Proper error messages with `Write-Error`
   - Checks `$LASTEXITCODE` for command success

6. **Output**
   - Uses `Write-Host` for normal output
   - Uses `Write-Error` for error messages
   - Maintains similar output format to original script

To use this script:

1. Save it as `backup-db.ps1`
2. Make sure MySQL is installed and accessible
3. If using 7-Zip method, ensure 7-Zip is installed
4. Run it in PowerShell:
   ```powershell
   .\backup-db.ps1
   ```

Note: You might need to:
1. Adjust the MySQL credentials
2. Change the backup directory path
3. Install 7-Zip if using the primary compression method
4. Or uncomment the alternative compression method if not using 7-Zip

Would you like me to explain any part in more detail or make any adjustments to the script?
