This error occurs when Docker can't start a container because port 3000 is already in use by another process. Let me help you resolve this issue.
First, let's check what's using port 3000 and then stop it. I'll create a script to help diagnose and fix this issue.

[Port Conflict Resolution Script]
```bash
#!/bin/bash

echo "Checking what's using port 3000..."
# For Windows (PowerShell)
netstat -ano | findstr :3000

echo -e "\nTo fix this issue, you can:"
echo "1. Stop the process using port 3000:"
echo "   - Find the PID (Process ID) from the output above"
echo "   - Run: taskkill /PID <PID> /F"
echo ""
echo "2. Or stop all Docker containers and remove them:"
echo "   docker stop \$(docker ps -aq)"
echo "   docker rm \$(docker ps -aq)"
echo ""
echo "3. Or change the port mapping in your docker-compose.yml:"
echo "   Change '3000:3000' to another port like '3001:3000'"
```

Common Solutions:
1. Stop the existing process using port 3000
2. Stop all Docker containers and start fresh
3. Change the port mapping in your docker-compose.yml
4. Check if you have multiple instances of your application running
